Container Orchestrator : A  container orchestrator is simply a tool to manage the containers. Kubernetes is a container orchestrator. It is capable to solutionize the integration of the following functionalities:
Runtime
Networking
Storage
Service Mesh
Logs and metrics
Tracing


 business perspective, the adoption of cloud-native tooling represents:
Agility - perform strategic transformations
Growth - quickly iterate on customer feedback
Service availability - ensures the product is available to customers 24/7

From a technical perspective, the adoption of cloud-native tooling represents:
Automation - release a service without human intervention
Orchestration - introduce a container orchestrator to manage thousands of services with minimal effort
Observability - ability to independently troubleshoot and debug each component
